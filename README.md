Ansible roles to setup metrics collection from an elasticsearch. Very similar to elasticsearch module of metricsbeat, 
but was created before the metricsbeat's introduction. Also, imo, it can be customized more easily.

Collectd part was adopted from https://github.com/phobos182/collectd-elasticsearch
